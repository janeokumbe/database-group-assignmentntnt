# database-group-assignmentnt
This project simulates the role of a database administrator tasked with designing and building a relational MySQL database for a Bookstore. It covers schema creation, table relationships, user access control, and data handling for core bookstore operations like orders, customers, books, and shipping.


This SQL script creates a database for a bookstore with tables for books, authors, publishers, and languages.
It includes the creation of tables with appropriate data types, primary keys, and foreign key constraints.
he script also includes comments to explain the purpose of each table and its columns.
This script is designed to be run in a MySQL environment.
It creates a database named BookStore_db and defines the tables as seen in the ERD diagram(<Book store relationship tables.drawio.pdf>):
